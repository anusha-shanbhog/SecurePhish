# SecurePhish
SecurePhish is an advanced AIML based system, employing a Hybrid Approach, to defend individuals, organizations, and businesses against the ever-evolving threat of phishing attacks. 
The model is trained using XGBoost Algorithm on URL, Domain and HTML and JavaScript Code based features of the URL. 
The website is determined as Safe or Phishing based on the score. The model has a very high accuracy and low false positive rate, and uses an optimisation mechanism at the backend using WhiteLists and BlackLists to ensure speed and efficiency. The model is 
deployed as an API at the backend and can be used as both, a website as well as a browser extension for the detection and blocking of phishing URLs.
